# gb_vids
A command line utility to download GB videos.

99% of the work on this was done by harryr0se. I just made changes so that it worked in Python 3. Please see below for the original:
https://github.com/harryr0se/giant_bomb_cli

**This requires Python 3 and https://pypi.org/project/requests/ to be installed.**

# Example 1: Downloading a single video
Let's say I want Drew's Iceland video. I can search for it by using:
```
vids.py --filter --name "iceland"
```
It'll display the ID as 7330. So I can use this command to download it at low quality:
```
vids.py --filter --id 7330 --quality "low" --download
```

# Example 2: Downloading a series
To get the ID of each series use:
```
vids.py --dump_video_shows
```
Then if I want to download all the Altered Beast videos in This is the Run at HD quality:
```
vids.py --filter --video_show 17 --name "altered beast" --quality "hd" --download
```

# FAQ

## Where can I get my api key from?
Your api key can be requested and found at http://www.giantbomb.com/api/

## Where is my api key stored?
Your api key is stored in your home directory (~/.giant_bomb_cli/config)

If you wish to change api key, just delete the config file and you'll be prompted to input a new one next time the script is run

# Updates
#### 2023-01-21
- updated dump_video_shows to grab over a 100 results
- will display the results received and the total possible results now
- added filter for video_type, should help with downloading shows with no video_show id
